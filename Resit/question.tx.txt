How has the relationship between the DALYs in France and the UK (two similarly
sized countries) changed over time? Are they becoming more similar, less similar?
From 48 to 61
From the figure: Both of them are generally showing a downward trend, but in the future, they may become increasingly different from each other.
I have not expected this result, especially that these two countries became increasingly different in recent years, and I think that may due to the different healthcare policy of these two countries in recent years.
